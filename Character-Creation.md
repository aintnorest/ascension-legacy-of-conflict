## Size Category Selection and Base Stats

When creating a character start with a miniature model you want to represent. The model's base size according to their largest dimension in millimeters determines its Size Category, which in turn defines its base stats. Each Size Category has a specific Size Value and associated costs for upgrades.

### Size Category Selection

Model base size determines the character's Size Category.

| Base Size | Size Value | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 25-39mm | 1 | 0 |

| 60-89mm | 3 | 2 |
| 90-129mm | 4 | 4 |

## Action Rules

This section details rules for creating & purchasing Actions.

Action Token Economy:
Each character gains Action Tokens equal to the number of actions they possess. This means characters with more actions have more Action Tokens available during their activation, allowing for greater tactical flexibility and the ability to perform more actions per turn.

For example:

- A character with 2 actions gains 2 Action Tokens per activation
- A character with 4 actions gains 4 Action Tokens per activation

Action Token Cost:
Actions require spending Action Tokens to activate. Some actions have multiple options for how many tokens to spend:

- ⭐ (1 Action Token)
- ⭐2 (2 Action Tokens)

Actions that allow spending more tokens typically provide enhanced effects, greater range, more damage, or additional benefits when more tokens are used.

### Attack Action Rules

Attack Skill Modifiers:
Each attack template applies an Attack Skill modifier:

- Area: -1
- Breakthrough: -1  
- Ricochet: -1

Token Usage:

- ⭐: Attack Skill - 2 + Template Modifier

Example: A character with Attack Skill 3 using an Area attack template:

- ⭐: 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 Attack Skill
