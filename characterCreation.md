## 1. Overview

### R-1.1.1 Point Buy System

Characters are created using a **point-buy system**. Points are spent to purchase core attributes, actions (attacks and abilities), and passive abilities.

### R-1.1.2 Cost Formatting Guide

Throughout this document, costs for progressive upgrades (like stat improvements or some range upgrades) are presented as **(incrementalCost: totalCostToReachThisLevel)**.

* **Incremental Cost:** The number before the colon represents the points spent to gain *this specific increment* from the previous level.
* **Total Cost:** The number after the colon represents the *cumulative* points spent to reach this specific level from its base (0) value.

### R-1.1.3 Symbols and Abbreviations Guide

To condense character profiles for easier reference, the following symbols are used:

**General:**

* **üî∑:** Primary Facet
* **üî∏:** Secondary Facet
* **‚ôªÔ∏èx2:** Exhaustion Option chosen (action inflicts 2 Exhaust Tokens)
* **‚àû:** Passive Ability

**Core Stats:**

* **üëü (Strides):** Movement units
* **‚ù§Ô∏è (Wounds):** Health
* **üõ°Ô∏è (Defense):** Defensive value
* **‚öîÔ∏è (Attack Skill):** Value added to card flip for attacks
* **üåê (Influence):** Area of effect around model

**Attack Templates:**

* **‚ë†:** Single Target
* **‚≠ï:** Area
* **üìè:** Breakthrough
* **üîó:** Ricochet

**Attack Modifiers:**

* **R:** Range (e.g., R:3" for 3-inch range)
* **A:** Area Diameter (e.g., A:2" for 2-inch diameter)
* **L:** Line Length (e.g., L:3" for 3-inch line length)
* **T:** Number of Targets (e.g., T:2 for 2 targets)
* **Btwn:** Range Between Targets (e.g., Btwn:2" for 2 inches between targets)
* **InitR:** Initial Range (for Ricochet, e.g., InitR:4")

**Suit Dependencies:**

* **‚ô†Ô∏è:** Spades
* **‚ô•Ô∏è:** Hearts
* **‚ô¶Ô∏è:** Diamonds
* **‚ô£Ô∏è:** Clubs
* **üÉè:** Always

### R-1.1.4 Total Character Profile Limit

The total number of Facets on a model's profile, which includes purchased Attack Actions, Ability Actions, Reaction Actions, and Passive Abilities, **MUST NOT** exceed 7.

### R-1.1.5 Minimum Action Diversity Requirement

Each model **MUST** purchase at least one **Attack Action** and at least one **Ability Action** or **Passive Ability**. If this requirement is not met, the model **CANNOT** be fielded.

### R-1.1.6 Primary vs. Secondary Facet Ratio

To ensure diverse and flexible character builds, a model's profile **MUST** include at least as many **Secondary Facets** as **Primary Facets**.

* An **Attack Action** is considered a **Primary Facet** if it is a **Primary Attack** type. It is a **Secondary Facet** if it is a **Secondary Attack** type.
* An **Ability Action** or **Reaction Action** with a total point cost of **10 points or more** is considered a **Primary Facet**.
* An **Ability Action** or **Reaction Action** with a total point cost of **less than 10 points** is considered a **Secondary Facet**.
* A **Passive Ability** with a total point cost of **10 points or more** is considered a **Primary Facet**.
* A **Passive Ability** with a total point cost of **less than 10 points** is considered a **Secondary Facet**.
* Core Attributes do not count towards this ratio.

### R-1.1.7 Maximum Single Item Cost

No single item (a stat increase, an entire attack action, an ability action, a reaction action, or a passive ability) **MAY** cost more than 40% of the model's total point cost. If an item would exceed this limit, its cost **MUST** be reduced (by lowering upgrades or options) until it is within the allowed percentage. This percentage applies to the *final cost* of the item after all modifiers.

## 2. Size Category Selection and Base Stats

### R-2.1.1 Size Category Assignment and Base Stats

Each model **MUST** be assigned a **Size Category** (from R-2.1.1 Model and Terrain Size Categories in the Core Rules) before any other choices. Size determines a model's starting **Strides**, **Wounds**, and **Influence**, as detailed in the **Base Stat Table** below.

**Base Stat Table:**

| Size | üëü Strides | ‚ù§Ô∏è Wounds | üåê Influence | ‚öîÔ∏è Attack Skill | üõ°Ô∏è Defense |
|:----:|:----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:----------:|
|  1   |     3      |    1     |      0"      |       0        |     2      |
|  2   |     2      |    1     |      1"      |       0        |     2      |
|  3   |     2      |    1     |      3"      |       0        |     2      |
|  4   |     1      |    2     |      4"      |       0        |     2      |
|  5   |     1      |    2     |      5"      |       0        |     2      |

* **Stride Improvement:** Each additional Stride beyond the model's Base Strides (from R-2.1.1) has a fixed cost based on the model's **Size Value**.
  * **Cost per +1 Stride:**
    * Size 1: 2 points
    * Size 2: 3 points
    * Size 3: 4 points
    * Size 4-5: 5 points
  * **Maximum Strides:** Base Strides + 3.

## 4. Actions and Abilities

Models purchase their Attack Actions, Ability Actions, and Reaction Actions from this section. Remember to track their total point cost and their Primary/Secondary designation for the ratio rule (R-1.1.6).

### R-4.1 General Action Rules

* **Exhaustion Option:** When purchasing any action (attack, ability, or reaction), the player **MAY** choose to make it more taxing:
  * The action inflicts 2 **Exhaust Tokens** (instead of 1) when used.
  * Reduces purchase cost by 2 points (cannot reduce below 1 point).
  * This option **MUST** be chosen at purchase and recorded on the model's profile.
* **Unique Action Requirement:** Unless an action explicitly states otherwise, a model **CANNOT** purchase the same exact action more than once. Each action on a model's profile **MUST** be unique in name and effect unless the action's description specifically permits multiple purchases.

### R-4.2 Attack Construction

Each model **MUST** have at least 1 **Attack Action**. When purchasing an Attack Action, players choose one of the available attack templates (Single Target, Area, Breakthrough, Ricochet) and then choose if it is a **Primary Attack** or a **Secondary Attack**.

* **Primary Attack:** This attack uses the model's full **Attack Skill** (from R-3.1) for its attack value.
* **Secondary Attack:** This attack uses the model's **Attack Skill - 2 (minimum 0)** for its attack value.

* **Attack Skill Cap for Area, Breakthrough, and Ricochet Attacks:** When making an Area, Breakthrough, or Ricochet attack, a model's **Attack Skill** (after any Primary/Secondary Attack modifiers) is considered to be a maximum of 4 for the purpose of the attack value, even if the model's actual Attack Skill is higher. Only Single Target attacks can benefit from an Attack Skill of 5 or 6.

### R-4.3 Ability Action List

Models **MUST** purchase at least one **Ability Action**.

#### R-4.3.0 Ability and Passive Naming Convention

All ability, reaction, and passive ability names in this section are purely descriptive of their mechanical effect. Players are encouraged to assign their own thematic names for narrative purposes. The format is:

`[Effect] [Target/Range/LOS] [Distance/Area] [Special Condition]`

#### R-4.3.1 Primary Ability Actions

These abilities generally have a cost of 10 points or more, making them Primary Facets (R-1.1.6).

| Ability                                 | Description                                 | Cost |
|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-----|
| Displace Target (Reach, Size -2)        | Throw target 2 sizes smaller within reach   | 12   |
| Displace Terrain (Reach, Size -2)       | Throw terrain 2 sizes smaller within reach  | 10   |

#### R-4.3.2 Secondary Ability Actions

These abilities generally have a cost of less than 10 points, making them Secondary Facets (R-1.1.6).

| Ability                      | Description                                                   | Cost |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:-----|
| Displace Self (LOS, 6")      | Place this model anywhere within 6" and line of sight         | 6    |
| Shift Self (1")              | Move this model 1"; does not count as movement                | 4    |
| Remove Temporary Effect (4") | Remove one temporary effect on a model within 4"              | 8    |
| Compel Movement (LOS, 4")    | Target can only move toward this model on its next activation | 8    |
| Displace Self (No LOS, 4")   | Place this model anywhere within 4", ignoring line of sight   | 8    |

### R-4.4 Reaction Action List

Reaction Actions also count towards the Primary/Secondary Facet ratio (R-1.1.6) based on their cost. Only one reaction may be used per trigger event. Reactions use Exhaust Tokens as other actions (R-3.2.5).

| Reaction                       | Trigger                        | Effect                                                   | Cost |
|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:-----|
| Negate Displacement (Self)     | When targeted by push or throw | Cannot be pushed or thrown this attack                   | 12   |
| Reduce Displacement (Self, 2") | When pushed or knocked back    | Reduce push/knockback distance by 2"                     | 8    |
| Displace Self (Reaction, 1")   | When targeted by an attack     | Move 1" before attack resolves, ^                        | 8    |
| Increase Defense               | When targeted by an attack     | Draw 3 cards for defense and discard 1 of players choice | 8    |

^ Attack doesn't happen if new position would make target invalid option. Attacker can change targets.

## 5. Attack Effects

Effects define the additional impact of an attack. When purchasing an effect, the player **MUST** choose its trigger condition: **Always**, **Match Suit**, or **Both Suits**. Each trigger condition has its own point cost. Unless an effect explicitly states otherwise, each effect **MAY** only be applied to the same action once.

### R-5.1 Effect Categories

Effects are chosen from the following categories: **Movement Effects**, **Temporary Effects**, and **Damage Effects**.

#### R-5.2 Movement Effects

Temporary effects last until removed (R-5.2.6 Shake) and may stack up to 3 times on a single target.

#### R-5.4 Other Effects

| Effect           | Description                                        | üÉè‚úîÔ∏è | üÉè‚úñÔ∏è | üÉè‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚úñÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚úñÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚úñÔ∏è | ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è |

**Null Strike** **CANNOT** be chosen unless at least one **Always** effect is present. **Null Strike** reduces the attack's cost by 3 points and the attack deals no damage but may apply effects.

### R-5.5 Effect Timing and Activation Requirements

When purchasing effects for attacks, two independent factors determine when the effect activates:

#### R-5.5.1 Effect Timing (When It Triggers)

Use the following symbols in the stat block to indicate when an effect applies:

* **‚úîÔ∏è (On Hit):** Effect applies only if the attack is successful.
* **‚úñÔ∏è (On Miss):** Effect applies only if the attack fails.
* **‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è (On Hit or Miss):** Effect applies regardless of whether the attack hits or misses.

*If no timing symbol is specified, the effect defaults to **On Hit** (‚úîÔ∏è).*

#### R-5.5.2 Suit Dependency (Card Requirements)

Each effect's activation also depends on the suits of the two cards flipped for the attack:

* **üÉè (Always):** Effect activates regardless of the suits flipped.
* **‚ô£Ô∏è (Match Suit - Clubs):** Effect activates only if at least one Club is flipped.
* **‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è (Match Suit - Club & Diamond):** Effect activates only if one Club and one Diamond are flipped.
* **‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è (Both Suits - Two Clubs):** Effect activates only if both cards flipped are Clubs.

#### R-5.5.3 Recording Effect Requirements

When recording an attack with effects on a character sheet, both the timing and suit dependency **MUST** be clearly indicated. Examples:

* **üÉè‚úîÔ∏è: Hinder** - Always triggers on hit
* **‚ô£Ô∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è: Knockback** - Triggers on Club match, on hit or miss
* **‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚úñÔ∏è: Throw** - Triggers on two Clubs, only on miss

## 6. Passive Abilities

This section funds special rules, passive benefits, or always-on effects that define a model's inherent capabilities or unique traits. A model **MAY** purchase up to 3 passive abilities, which count towards the **Total Character Profile Limit** (R-1.1.4) and the Primary/Secondary Facet ratio (R-1.1.6).

## 7. Leader Rules

### R-7.1 Leader Designation and Elite Activation

Each army **MUST** have exactly one model designated as its **Leader**. The Leader model gains the **Elite Activation** special rule. No army **MAY** include more than one Leader at any time. The cost of the "Leader" feature itself is 0 points, but it enables the model to purchase Leader-only abilities.

* **Elite Activation:** When this Leader model activates, after it has completed its actions, you may immediately activate one additional friendly model that has not yet activated this Round. The additional model must have a total point cost of half or less than this Leader model's cost. This secondary activation follows all normal rules for a model activation, except the activated model cannot pass its activation.

### R-7.2 Leader-Only Abilities (Work in Progress)

This section will detail additional abilities that only a model designated as a **Leader** may purchase.

*Work in Progress: Leader-only abilities will be added in a future update.*

## 8. Recording and Profile Requirements

### R-8.1 Action and Stat Recording

All purchased actions (attacks, abilities, reactions), stat improvements, and passive abilities **MUST** be clearly recorded on the model's profile or character sheet.

Each attack's stat block **MUST** include: Attack Name, Template (using symbol), Type (üî∑/üî∏), Range, Area/Line/Targets (using symbols and single line format), all Effects (with suit dependency and abbreviations), and Exhaustion Option (if chosen).

### R-8.3 Suit Dependency Recording

If an attack or ability effect is suit-dependent, the chosen suit(s) **MUST** be recorded on the model's profile.

### R-8.4 Reaction and Ability Trigger Recording

The trigger condition for each reaction (and any ability with a trigger) **MUST** be clearly recorded on the model's profile.

### R-8.5 Total Cost Recording

The total point cost of the character, including all stat improvements and purchased Facets, **MUST** be clearly recorded on the character sheet.
