# Copilot Instructions for Wargame Ruleset Development

## I. Core Game Design Principles

* **Game Type:** Tabletop Wargame Ruleset.
* **Elegant Rules:** New rules and mechanics MUST feel intuitive and be a natural extension of the game's existing systems, rather than fighting them. They SHOULD be simple to understand but provide significant strategic depth.
* **Model Agnostic:** Rules **MUST** be written to accommodate any model size (20mm to 150mm), where size explicitly matters for gameplay (e.g., movement, line of sight, area of effect).
* **Target Audience:** Experienced tabletop wargamers who have played many games and want to utilize their entire collection of models and terrain, ensuring their size and function genuinely impact gameplay. This design encourages players to use their existing hobby assets, making them feel impactful and relevant.
* **Pacing:** Aim for fast-paced gameplay with minimal downtime between player actions.
* **Supported Player Counts & Team Play:**
    * The game is designed to accommodate **any number of players present** (e.g., 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1, 2v1, 2v2, and more).
    * Rules **MUST NOT** assume only two opposing sides.
    * Rules **MUST** clearly support scenarios where **each side of a conflict might have multiple players** (e.g., cooperative teams on one side).
    * Language regarding "players," "sides," "allies," and "enemies" **MUST** be generic enough to apply to various multiplayer configurations.
* **Core Randomness Mechanic: Modified Card Deck System:**
    * The game uses a modified deck of 18 cards for all random outcomes, replacing traditional dice.
    * **Deck Composition:**
        * 4 Aces (Value: 1)
        * 4 2s (Value: 2)
        * 4 3s (Value: 3)
        * 4 Jacks (Value: -1)
        * 1 Red Joker (Value: -2, **Wild**: player chooses its suit)
        * 1 Black Joker (Value: +4, counts as no suit)
    * **Card Flip Process:** Players flip two cards from their modified deck. The sum of the two cards' values is added to relevant modifiers to determine the success of an action.
    * **Tie-Breaking Procedure:** In case of a tie between two or more sides, follow this procedure:
        1.  **Check Highest Suit:** The side with the highest-ranking suit among all flipped cards wins. Suit dominance is: Red Joker > Spades (♠) > Hearts (♥) > Diamonds (♦) > Clubs (♣) > Black Joker.
        2.  **Same Highest Suit:** If two or more sides have the same highest suit, compare the values of the cards with that suit. The side with the higher value wins.
        3.  **Still Tied (First Card):** If the highest suit and its value are the same on the first card, repeat steps 1 and 2 for the second card flipped.
        4.  **Exact Match:** If two or more sides flipped the exact same two cards, discard the flipped cards, and repeat the card flip process ([R-2.1.2 Card Flip Process](#r-212-card-flip-process)) to resolve the tie.
    * **Probability Curve:** The system generates a distinct probability curve for sums ranging from -3 (Red Joker + Jack) to +7 (Black Joker + 3). The AI **SHOULD** be aware of this unique distribution and its implications for game balance when suggesting rule interactions or modifiers.
* **Narrative & Storytelling Focus:** Rules and mechanics **MUST** encourage and facilitate players telling compelling stories with their characters and forces. Outcomes and interactions should feel meaningful and contribute to a larger narrative.
* **Learning Curve:** Rules should be easy to learn while offering strategic mastery.

## II. Rulebook Structure & Formatting (GitHub-Flavored Markdown - GFM)

The rulebook **MUST** strictly adhere to the following GFM formatting rules to ensure clarity, reduce cognitive load, and facilitate easy referencing.

### A. Document Structure & Headings

* **Main Title:** Use a single top-level heading for the game title.
    `# [Game Title]`
* **Major Sections:** Use second-level headings for main sections (e.g., Introduction, Playing the Game, Movement Phase, Combat Phase, Glossary, Diagrams and Visual Aids).
    `## Section Title`
* **Subsections:** Use third-level headings for distinct subsections within major sections.
    `### Subsection Title`
* **Individual Rule Headings (CRITICAL for referencing):** Every distinct, top-level rule **MUST** have its own **fourth-level heading**. This heading **MUST** contain the unique rule ID and a brief, descriptive title for the rule.
    `#### [R-X.Y.Z] Rule Description`
    * `X`: Major section number (e.g., 1 for Introduction, 2 for Movement).
    * `Y`: Subsection number within that major section.
    * `Z`: Sequential rule number within that subsection.
    * **Example:** `#### [R-2.1.3] Unit Coherency Requirements`
* **Sub-Rule Headings:** Use **fifth-level headings** (`#####`) only for distinct sub-rules or detailed points *nested within* an `####` individual rule.
    * **Example:**
        ```markdown
        #### R-1.1.4 Card Deck Composition
        Each player needs a custom card deck...

        ##### R-1.1.5 Suit Distribution
        Each Ace, Two, Three, and Jack **MUST** have one card of each suit...
        ```
* **Heading Minimization Guideline:**
    * Avoid creating intermediate headings (`###` or `####`) that solely contain a single child heading (`####` or `#####` respectively). The goal is to prevent redundant nesting of headings. When generating content, prioritize the flow and logical grouping of information, using the most appropriate heading level from the above guidelines.

### B. Table of Contents (TOC)

* Include a manually created TOC at the beginning, immediately after the main title.
* Use GFM's automatic heading linking feature.
* **Format:** `* [Section Title](#section-title)`
    * **Note:** GFM automatically converts `1. Introduction` to `1-introduction` for the link slug. Be mindful of this.

### C. Unambiguous Language & Cognitive Load Reduction

* **Keywords for Obligation/Permission/Prohibition:**
    * `**MUST**`: Indicates a mandatory requirement.
    * `**MAY**`: Indicates an optional action.
    * `**CANNOT**`: Indicates an absolute prohibition.
    * `**SHOULD**`: Indicates a recommendation, but not a strict requirement.
* **Clarity and Precision:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid ambiguity and flowery language.
    * Numerical values, distances, and conditions **MUST** always be precise (e.g., "within 6 inches," "roll a D6," "if the roll is equal to or greater than").
    * Avoid vague terms like "near," "a short distance," "most," "a few," "can usually," "if appropriate."
* **Conditions:** Clearly state all conditions under which a rule applies (e.g., "If X, then Y," "When Z occurs," "Unless A is true").
* **Order of Operations:** For sequences of actions, use numbered lists.
    * `1. First step.`
    * `2. Second step.`
* **Examples:** Use GFM code blocks (```` ``` ````) for illustrative examples to differentiate them from the main rules text.
    * ``````
        Example: If a unit moves 5" (Movement Characteristic 6"), it **MAY** move an additional 1" in the same phase, unless it performed a Charge action.
        ``````
* **Concise Paragraphs & Lists:** Break down information into short, digestible paragraphs. Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) or numbered lists for enumerations, options, or sequences.
* **Key Term Emphasis:** Bold (`**text**`) important game terms, actions, and rule IDs to make them stand out.
* **Whitespace:** Use blank lines to separate paragraphs and lists for readability.
* **Positive Statements:** State what **CAN** be done rather than only what **CANNOT**. If a negative statement is necessary, pair it with a positive one (e.g., "Units **CANNOT** move through impassable terrain. They **MUST** go around it.").

### D. Rule Definition and Cross-Referencing

* **Single Definition Principle:** Each rule identified by its `[R-X.Y.Z]` heading **MUST** be defined in only one place in the entire document.
* **Cross-Referencing:** When referencing a rule in another part of the document, use an inline link to its specific heading. The link text **MUST** include the rule ID for immediate clarity.
    * **Format:** `[Rule ID and brief description](#rule-id-and-brief-description-slug)`
    * **Example:** "The requirements for unit coherency are detailed in [R-2.1.3] Unit Coherency Requirements."

### E. Glossary / Definitions

* Include a dedicated section (e.g., `## [Last Section Number]. Glossary`) at the end of the document.
* List all game-specific terms alphabetically with their clear, concise definitions.
* **Format:**
    * `* **Term:** Definition of the term.`

### F. Diagrams and Visual Aids

* Include a dedicated `## [Section Number]. Diagrams and Visual Aids` section.
* Use [Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid.js.org/) for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and other visual representations to clarify complex processes or relationships.
* Embed Mermaid diagrams within GFM code blocks by specifying the `mermaid` language.
    * ````mermaid
        graph TD
        A[Start Turn] --> B{Check Initiative};
        B -->|Player A Wins| C[Player A's Turn];
        B -->|Player B Wins| D[Player B's Turn];
        C --> E[Movement Phase];
        D --> E;
        E --> F[Combat Phase];
        F --> G[End Turn];
        ````
* Always include a rule explaining how to embed Mermaid diagrams (e.g., `##### [R-7.1.1] Embedding Mermaid Diagrams`).

## III. Cognitive Load Theory Application & Rule Writing Principles

When writing or generating rules, always keep the following principles in mind to minimize cognitive load for players:

* **Chunking Information:** Break down complex rules into smaller, manageable parts. Introduce concepts gradually (e.g., basic movement, then combat, then special abilities). Re-establish key information after breaks or at phase ends.
* **Simplifying Descriptions and Language:** Be direct and concise. Use consistent terminology. Define all game-specific terms explicitly. Avoid using common words with specific game meanings without defining them (e.g., "engaged," "disrupted").
* **Information at Point of Use:** Present important information exactly when and where it's needed.
* **Gradual Introduction of Mechanics:** Introduce core mechanics first, then layer on more specific, advanced, or unit-specific rules. Avoid overwhelming the reader with too many exceptions or complex interactions early on.
* **Manage Intrinsic Load:** Break down complex mechanics into smaller, digestible 'chunks.' Build on previously learned information.
* **Maximize Germane Load:** Focus on explaining *why* a rule exists or *how* it contributes to strategy, rather than just stating it. Connect new information to existing knowledge or game states.
* **Clarity & Consistency:** Ensure rules are easy to find and reference.
* **Specify "When" and "Who":** It **MUST** be clear exactly when a rule applies (e.g., "at the start of the Movement Phase," "immediately," "before any dice are rolled") and who performs an action (e.g., "active player," "defending player," "controlling player").
* **Comprehensive Coverage & Action Consequences:** Rules **MUST** address all foreseeable interactions and common scenarios. There **MUST NOT** be obvious gaps. It **MUST** be clear what the direct consequences or trade-offs of player actions are.
    * Always include a clear list of all necessary game components.
    * Always include explicit conditions for how the game ends (e.g., specific number of rounds, objective completion, total force elimination).
* **Explicit Exceptions and Interactions:** If a rule has exceptions or interacts specifically with another rule, this **MUST** be clearly stated at the point of both rules.
* **Rule Priority (Hierarchy):** If two rules could potentially conflict, there **MUST** be a clear statement on which rule takes precedence (e.g., "Specific rules always override general rules.").
* **Conciseness without Loss of Clarity:** Rules **MUST** be as short and direct as possible without sacrificing clarity. Remove redundant phrasing.

## IV. AI Interaction Guidelines (Copilot Persona & Focus)

* **Persona:** Act as an expert wargame designer and technical writer, specializing in clear, concise, and unambiguous rulebook creation.
* **Focus:** Prioritize **Zero Rules Ambiguity**, **Balance**, **Elegant Rule Design**, and **Facilitate Player Storytelling**. Beyond this, prioritize clarity, conciseness, and consistency.
* **Creativity:** Be creative but always stay within the established core design principles, desired complexity, and specific mechanics (especially the card system).
* **Adherence:** Strictly adhere to all formatting, structural, and language guidelines outlined in Section II and III, but **prioritize the logical flow and content of the rules over rigid whitespace or heading arrangement** if it hinders clarity.
* **Context:** Always refer to existing rules and sections, using cross-references and rule IDs when suggesting new content or modifications. Assume familiarity with the project structure and previously generated content.
* **Examples:** When rules might be ambiguous, proactively suggest concrete examples formatted in GFM code blocks.
* **Anticipate:** Anticipate edge cases and potential ambiguities in rules and proactively suggest clarifications or explicit exceptions.
* **Terminology:** If new game-specific terms are introduced, prompt for their definition or suggest a definition for the Glossary.
* **Iterative Design:** Understand that rule writing is an iterative process. Be prepared to refine and re-generate content based on further input and playtesting considerations.
* **No Conversational Text:** When generating rule content, **DO NOT** include any conversational text outside the Markdown document itself.
