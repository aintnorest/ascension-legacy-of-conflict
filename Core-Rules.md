# Core Rules

Core Rules for Ascension: Legacy of Conflict

## Game Components

Required materials and components needed to play Ascension: Legacy of Conflict.

### Character Requirements

All character miniatures MUST be between 25mm and 170mm base size. Character size directly impacts gameplay, including movement, line of sight, and area of effect calculations. Players MUST agree on character sizes before game begins

### Terrain Requirements

Players MUST provide terrain pieces to create a dynamic battlefield. Terrain MAY include buildings, forests, obstacles, and other environmental features.

**Terrain Guidelines:**

- Terrain pieces MAY be outside the 25mm-170mm range unlike characters
- All terrain sizes and special properties MUST be agreed upon during setup
- Terrain affects line of sight, movement, and combat as defined in terrain interaction rules

### Measuring Tools

Players SHOULD have appropriate measuring tools for accurate gameplay.

**Recommended Tools:**

- Spare bases of every size their force uses as measuring templates
- Measuring tape or ruler for distance verification
- Movement measurements are done in millimeters as this matches common base sizing standards

### Specialty Card Deck

Each player needs a custom 18-card deck with specific composition replacing traditional dice mechanics.

**Deck Composition:**

- 4 Aces (value: 1)
- 4 Twos (value: 2)
- 4 Threes (value: 3)
- 4 Jacks (value: -1)
- 1 Red Joker (value: -2, Wild Suit)
- 1 Black Joker (value: +4, No Suit)

**Suit Distribution:**

Each Ace, Two, Three, and Jack MUST have one card of each suit: ‚ô†Ô∏è Spades, ‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts, ‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds, and ‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs.

### Token Requirements

Players MUST provide various tokens to track game states and effects.

**Required Tokens:**

- Action Tokens for tracking character action capacity
- Activated Tokens to mark characters that have activated this turn
- Status Effect Tokens (Slow, Weaken, Hinder, Damage Over Time)
- Scenario-specific objective and zone markers as required

**Token Guidelines:**

- Tokens MUST be clearly distinguishable from each other
- Players SHOULD use consistent token types throughout the game

### Rule Priority and Conflicts

When rules conflict or create ambiguity, follow this resolution hierarchy.

**Priority Order:**

- Specific rules ALWAYS override general rules
- Character abilities override core rules when explicitly stated
- Scenario rules override core rules for that specific game
- If ambiguity remains, players MUST agree on interpretation before proceeding

Players SHOULD resolve rule questions immediately to maintain game flow.

## Resolution Mechanic

The game uses a card-based resolution mechanic instead of dice to provide a unique probability curve and allow for more strategic play. The card system introduces memory, tension, and the potential for players to track which cards have been played, rewarding skillful planning and risk assessment.

### Card Value Assignment

Each card in the custom deck has a specific value:

**Deck Composition:**

- 4 Aces (value: 1)
- 4 Twos (value: 2)
- 4 Threes (value: 3)
- 4 Jacks (value: -1)
- 1 Red Joker (value: -2, Wild Suit)
- 1 Black Joker (value: +4, No Suit)

### Card Flip Process

When a random outcome is required, the active player MUST flip two cards from their custom deck. The sum of their values, plus any relevant modifiers, determines the result.

**Important:** In contests (like initiative), all participants flip cards. In attacks, only the attacker flips cards unless a specific ability allows the defender to flip cards.

### Deck Cycling

Card management follows these rules:

**After Use:**

- Flipped cards MUST be placed in a discard pile face down
- Discard pile contents are not public knowledge

**Deck Refresh:**

- When the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck
- After shuffling, discard 1 card face down from the top of the new deck
- This discarded card is not revealed and CANNOT be examined

### Tie-Breaking Procedure

In case of tied totals between two or more sides, follow this procedure:

1. **Check Highest Suit:** The side with the highest-ranking suit among all flipped cards wins. Suit dominance is: Red üÉè > ‚ô†Ô∏è Spades > ‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts > ‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds > ‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs > Black üÉè.
2. **Same Highest Suit:** If two or more sides have the same highest suit, compare the values of the cards with that suit. The side with the highest value wins.
3. **Still Tied (First Card):** If the highest suit and its value are the same on the first card, repeat steps 1 and 2 for the second card flipped.
4. **Exact Match:** If two or more sides flipped the exact same two cards, discard the flipped cards and repeat the card flip process to resolve the tie.

### Probability Awareness

Players SHOULD be aware that the card system produces sums from -3 to +7 with specific probabilities:

**Most Common Results:** Sums of 2, 4, and 0-5 (13-15% each)
**Least Common Results:** Sums of -3 and 7 (2.61% each)
**Key Insight:** The probability curve changes as cards are used, creating strategic timing decisions.

## Game Flow

Core mechanics governing how the game is played from turn to turn.

### Player and Team Rules

Rules for player configurations, initiative, and team coordination that apply to all games.

#### Supported Player Configurations

The game accommodates flexible player counts and team arrangements:

**Supported Configurations:**

- 1v1 (traditional two-player)
- 1v1v1 (three-player free-for-all)
- 1v1v1v1 (four-player free-for-all)
- 2v1 (two players vs one player)
- 2v2 (team vs team)
- Additional configurations as agreed by all players

The game is designed to accommodate all players present, with systems to help balance experience and skill levels.

#### Initiative Order and Team Coordination

Initiative and activation order rules for all games:

**Initiative Determination:**

- At the start of the game, all sides determine Initiative using the card flip process
- Once Initiative order is established, it persists for the remainder of the game
- At the start of each Round, play continues from where it left off in the previous Round

**Team Coordination:**

- If a side consists of multiple players (a team), those players MUST decide their internal activation order immediately after initiative is determined
- This internal order MUST be maintained for the duration of the game
- If a player on a team runs out of characters to activate, remaining team members continue in the established order before passing to the next side

**Player Elimination:**

- If a side or player has no characters left to activate, they are skipped in the Initiative order until the next Round
- Eliminated players MAY still participate in team discussions unless scenario rules specify otherwise

#### Force Point Balancing

Balancing mechanism for asymmetric player counts and experience levels:

**Underdog Bonus:**

If a side has fewer total force points than the agreed-upon total, it gains a bonus equal to half the difference (rounded down). This bonus applies to Initiative rolls and other contested actions as specified by scenario rules

**Experience Balancing:**

Players SHOULD consider pairing systems and force point adjustments to balance different experience and skill levels when setting up games.

### Turn Structure

Rules governing the overall structure and flow of each turn.

#### Turn Steps

Each turn follows these sequential steps:

1. **Activation Phase**: Players take turns activating one character at a time. Place an Activated token next to each character that has activated.
2. **End Phase**: Remove Activated Tokens. Not Action tokens, just the Activated tokens that indicate a character has activated this turn.

Players MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

#### Pass Activation

A player MAY choose to pass their activation instead of selecting a character if the opponent has more characters left to activate.

#### End Turn Conditions

The turn ends when one of the following conditions is met:

**Automatic End Conditions:**

- All players have passed their activation consecutively
- All characters on the table have been activated this turn
- A scenario-specific end condition is triggered

**Turn Cleanup:**

When a turn ends:

1. Check for victory conditions or scenario objectives
2. Begin the next turn's Initiative Phase

Players MUST complete all cleanup steps before starting the next turn.

### Activation Rules

Rules governing character activation and action token usage.

#### Character Activation Declaration

When it is a player's turn to activate, they MUST declare which specific character they are activating before taking any actions.

**Declaration Requirements:**

- Clearly identify the specific character being activated
- The character MUST be under the player's control
- The character CANNOT have been activated earlier this turn
- Declaration is binding - the player CANNOT change to a different character once declared

#### Action Token System

Characters use Action Tokens to perform abilities during their activation.

**Token Mechanics:**

- Each character starts each turn with a number of Action Tokens equal to their Action Capacity
- Action Tokens are spent to use Attack Actions, Ability Actions, Response Actions, and Move Actions
- Action Tokens are saved between turns and only returned to the pool at the start of the characters activation and only 1 per action. If a player uses multiple action tokens on an action it will take multiple turns to return to the pool.
- Action Tokens CANNOT be transferred between characters unless an ability specifically allows it

**Token Tracking:**

Players MUST track Action Token expenditure for each character clearly. Characters CANNOT perform actions if they lack sufficient Action Tokens.

## Attack Action Resolution Sequence

When a character performs an Attack Action, follow this step-by-step process:

1. **Declare Target and Attack:** The attacking player MUST clearly identify the target character and which specific Attack Action is being used.

2. **Calculate Total Attack Value:**
   - Attacker flips two cards and sums their values
   - Add the character's Attack Skill
   - Add any Attack Bonuses from abilities, equipment, or conditions
   - Subtract any **Hinder** tokens affecting the attacker
   - **Formula:** Card Total + Attack Skill + Attack Bonuses - Hinder Tokens = Total Attack Value

3. **Calculate Total Defense Value:**
   - Use the defender's Defense value
   - Add any Defense Bonuses from abilities, equipment, cover, or conditions  
   - Subtract any **Weaken** tokens affecting the defender
   - **Formula:** Defense + Defense Bonuses - Weaken Tokens = Total Defense Value

4. **Determine Hit or Miss:**
   - **Hit:** If Total Attack Value > Total Defense Value
   - **Miss:** If Total Attack Value ‚â§ Total Defense Value

5. **Calculate Damage (if Hit):**
   - **Damage = Total Attack Value - Total Defense Value**
   - Damage MUST be at least 1 if the attack hits

6. **Apply Damage:**
   - Reduce the target's current Wounds by the damage amount
   - If Wounds reach 0 or below, the character is defeated

7. **Apply Attack Effects:**
   - Resolve any special effects specified by the Attack Action
   - Apply any temporary conditions inflicted by the attack
   - Effects are applied regardless of whether the attack hit or missed unless specifically stated otherwise

## Movement Rules

Rules governing character movement and stride usage during Move Actions.

### Move Action Basics

Move Action is the default action available to all characters and does not need to be purchased during character creation.

**Action Token Usage:**

- A Move Action can use one or two Action Tokens
- For each token used, take one Move Action
- These actions CANNOT be split up
- If there is already an Action Token on the Move Action's token slot, the character CANNOT take the action, just like all other actions

### Movement Mechanics

When a character performs movement, follow these steps for each Stride spent:

1. **Adjust Facing:** Before each Stride, the character MAY adjust its facing to any direction
2. **Determine Stride Length:**
   - If moving in a straight line directly forward from current facing, Stride length equals the **Longest Base Dimension**
   - If not moving directly forward, Stride length equals the **Shortest Base Dimension**
3. **Move:** The character MAY move up to the determined Stride length per Stride spent

**Example:** A character with a 40mm x 25mm oval base moves straight forward using 40mm per Stride. Moving sideways or diagonally uses 25mm per Stride.

### Terrain Interaction

Characters can interact with terrain during movement using these rules:

**Step Over Terrain:**

- Characters MAY cross terrain with Size Value up to half their own Size Value (rounded down) without spending additional Strides
- Characters MUST end movement on a surface they can physically stand on

**Climbing Terrain:**

- Characters MAY climb terrain with Size Value equal to or less than their own Size Value
- Climbing costs 1 Stride per full Size Value difference between character and terrain
- After climbing, place character within 1/2" of the climbed edge

**Example:** A Size 1 character climbing Size 3 terrain spends 2 Strides (3 - 1 = 2).

### Special Stride Actions

Characters can spend Strides for special actions during Move Actions:

**Shake:**

- Character MAY spend 1 Stride to remove 1 temporary condition token from itself
- Character CANNOT perform more than 1 Shake per Move Action

**Interact:**

- Character MAY spend 1 Stride to interact with terrain or scenario piece
- Character CANNOT perform more than 1 Interact per Move Action
- Must be in base contact with the target to interact

## Terrain Rules

Rules governing terrain interaction, destruction, and environmental effects.

### Cover and Line of Sight

Terrain affects visibility and protection based on relative sizes:

**No Cover:** Clear line of sight between characters

**Partial Cover:** +1 to Defense if terrain Size equals Character Size - 1

**Full Cover:** +2 to Defense if terrain Size is less than or equal to Character Size - 2

**Obscured:** No line of sight if terrain Size is greater than or equal to Character Size

### Terrain Destruction and Interaction

Rules for attacking and destroying terrain features:

**Attacking Terrain:**

1. Declare terrain piece as attack target
2. Terrain Defense equals its Size Value (unless modified by terrain type)
3. Terrain Wounds equals its Size Value (unless modified by terrain type)
4. If damage equals or exceeds remaining Wounds, terrain is destroyed
5. Apply scenario-specific destruction effects as agreed during setup
6. Characters on destroyed terrain resolve falling effects

**Terrain Types:**

**Standard Terrain:**

- Defense = Size Value
- Wounds = Size Value

**Reinforced Terrain:**

- Defense = Size Value + 2
- Wounds = Size Value √ó 2
- Can only be damaged by attacks dealing at least Size Value damage in a single hit

**Fragile Terrain:**

- Defense = 0
- Wounds = 1
- Destroyed by any successful attack or by characters with higher Size Value moving through

**Indestructible Terrain:**

- CANNOT be targeted or destroyed unless scenario rules specify otherwise

### Specialized Terrain Features

Rules for interactive and environmental terrain:

**Multilevel Terrain:**

- Terrain pieces MAY have multiple designated levels with defined sizes
- Line of sight blocked by intervening levels unless both characters on same level or clear path exists
- Area of Effect attacks only affect characters on the same level unless specified otherwise

**Traversable Features (Stairs, Ladders, Ramps):**

- Moving between adjacent levels costs 1 Stride regardless of height difference
- Characters CANNOT be pushed or thrown up these features unless special rules allow

**Bridges and Walkways:**

- Treated as standard ground for movement
- Characters MAY fall if pushed, thrown, or end movement unsupported
- Provide Cover based on Size Value and structure

**Interactive Features (Doors, Gates):**

- Can be opened/closed by spending 1 Stride when in base contact
- Open features allow movement and line of sight; closed features block both

**Difficult Terrain:**

- Each Stride goes half distance while in difficult terrain
- If character size allows Step Over, they are not impaired by difficult terrain

**Impassable Terrain:**

- CANNOT be moved through, climbed, or ended upon
- Characters pushed into impassable terrain stop at edge and suffer 1 additional damage per terrain Size Value

**Hazardous Terrain:**

- When character enters or starts activation in hazardous terrain, flip two cards
- If sum is 0 or less, character suffers 1 Wound and gains **Hinder**
- Specific effects MUST be agreed upon during setup

## Special Rules

Additional rules covering temporary conditions and forced movement effects.

### Temporary Conditions

Status effects that can be inflicted by attacks and abilities. Each condition can stack up to 2 times. All temporary conditions stack their effect strength except Damage Over Time (DOT). All stacks must be removed before DOT's effect stops.

**Slow:**

- Target loses 1 Stride (minimum of 1)
- Stacks: Multiple applications increase Stride loss

**Weaken:**

- Target's Defense is reduced by 1
- Stacks: Multiple applications increase Defense reduction

**Hinder:**

- Target's Attack Skill is reduced by 1
- Stacks: Multiple applications increase Attack Skill reduction

**Damage Over Time:**

- Target suffers 1 Wound at the end of its activation
- Stacks: Multiple applications do NOT increase Wounds suffered, but all stacks must be removed before effect stops

### Forced Movement Effects

Rules for pushing characters and resulting damage:

**Push:**

- Push target directly away by half the size difference (minimum 1")
- CANNOT push targets more than one size larger than the pusher

**Falling:**

- Character falls when moved to an unsupported position
- Can occur due to Push, Throw, or terrain destruction

**Falling Damage:**

- Falling character gains **Slow**, **Weaken**, or **Hinder** (character owner's choice)
- Character suffers damage equal to height fallen in size categories (minimum 1) plus the character's size (rounded down, minimum 0)
- Falling damage ignores Defense

**Character Impact:**

- If falling character lands on another character, both gain **Slow**, **Weaken**, or **Hinder** (respective owner's choice)
- Each character suffers 1 damage per size category of the other character
- Smaller character is displaced to avoid base contact using minimum movement
