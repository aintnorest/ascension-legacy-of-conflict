## 1.1 Game Setting and Lore

Ascension: Legacy of Conflict is set in the vastness of the multiverse, where mercenary companies—known variously as Companies, Units, Clans, Fellowships, Syndicates, Dogs of War, Sellswords, or Contractors—compete for glory, profit, and survival. Each group is willing to resolve conflicts through force, for a price. Whether fighting for personal ambition, a higher cause, or simple survival, every force leaves its mark on the tapestry of endless war.

## 1.2 Core Concepts

* **Model Agnostic:** Players **MAY** use any miniatures from 20mm to 150mm scale. Model size is significant and directly impacts gameplay.
* **Customizable Forces:** Players create teams with leaders and unique characters, allowing for narrative-driven or competitive play.
* **Card-Based Resolution:** All random outcomes use a custom card deck, reducing the impact of streaks of bad luck and providing a unique probability curve.
* **Victory Conditions:** Each side has its own objectives, but to truly win, players **MUST** also hinder their opponents.
* **Campaign Play:** In campaign games, forces can be upgraded and stories emerge over multiple battles.

## 1.3 Required Components

* Miniatures (25mm–170mm scale)
* Terrain pieces
* Measuring tape or ruler (inches or centimeters)
* The custom card deck (see core rules for details)
* Tokens to mark statuses and effects
* Scenario-specific zone markers or tokens (as required)

## 1.4 Player Count and Game Length

* Supported player counts: 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1, 2v1, 2v2, and more.
* The game is designed to accommodate all players present, with pairing systems to help balance experience and skill levels.
* Typical game duration: Approximately 45 minutes per side at standard point values. Game length varies with player count and scenario.

## 1.5 Inspirations and Design Goals

Ascension draws inspiration from games such as Warmachine, Hordes, X-Wing, Marvel Crisis Protocol, and Bushido. The design emphasizes balance, quick play, and strategic depth. The goal is to let players use their favorite models from any collection, tell compelling stories, and engage in a game that rewards thoughtful planning and creative force building.
