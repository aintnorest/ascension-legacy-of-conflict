#### R-3.2.1 Turn Steps Overview

During a Turn, the active side follows these steps in order:

1. **Pass Activation (Optional)** ([R-3.2.2 Pass Activation Option](#r-322-pass-activation-option))
2. **Choose and Declare Activation** ([R-3.2.3 Model Activation Declaration](#r-323-model-activation-declaration))
3. **Manage Action Tokens** ([R-3.2.4 Action Token Management](#r-324-action-token-management))
4. **Perform Actions** ([R-3.2.5 Action Token System](#r-325-action-token-system))
5. **End of Turn** ([R-3.2.6 End of Turn Procedures](#r-326-end-of-turn-procedures))

#### R-3.2.2 Pass Activation Option

If all opposing sides have at least 2 more un-activated models than the active side, the active side **MAY** choose to pass their activation. If this option is chosen:

* The active side activates no model for this Turn.
* The activation is immediately passed to the next side in initiative order.
* The active side's Turn ends.

#### R-3.2.3 Model Activation Declaration

The active side **MUST** select a friendly model that has not activated this Round and declare it as the **Active Model** for this Turn.

#### R-3.2.4 Action Token Management

At the start of the Active Model's activation, perform the following steps in order:

1. **Discard Remaining Tokens:** Remove all unspent Action Tokens from the previous activation.
2. **Remove Action Tokens:** Remove one Action Token from each of the model's actions.
3. **Gather New Tokens:** The model gains Action Tokens equal to the number of actions it possesses (excluding Passive actions).

#### R-3.2.5 Action Token System

During its activation, the Active Model **MAY** spend Action Tokens to use actions or perform movement:

**Action Usage:**
* **Standard actions:** Cost 1 Action Token to use
* **Exhausting actions:** Cost 2 Action Tokens to use

**Movement Actions:**
* **Single Move Action:** Cost 1 Action Token
* **Double Move Action:** Cost 2 Action Tokens (allows two separate Move Actions)

**Action Types:**
* **Attack Actions:** Allow the model to perform attack actions  
* **Ability Actions:** Allow special actions that can be used during activation
* **Reaction Actions:** Allow responses to specific triggers during any player's turn

A model's activation ends when it chooses to end it OR when it has no remaining Action Tokens to spend.

**Note:** Reaction Actions **MAY** be used outside of the model's activation when their trigger conditions are met, spending Action Tokens as normal. If a model has no Action Tokens remaining, it **CANNOT** use Reaction
